Hi, I'm Johnny.
I'm currently a data science student.
I'm right now fine tuning my knowledge of neural nets (which have become an obsession of mine).
I'm currently building a predictive model based on Final Fantasy XIV market board data for my friends.
You can reach me at my email: jvduchene@gmail.com

Data science has gone from being a professional aspiration to a full-on hobby of mine!
